    <h2>About</h2>

    <img src="Facetune_22-06-2023-21-01-45.jpeg" alt="Morgan Yadron's Headshot" class="headshot">

    <p><strong>Morgan David Yadron</strong> recently graduated <em>magna cum laude</em> from the University of Arizona with a B.A. in Psychology and a minor in Philosophy. With a GPA of 3.7, his academic work reflects a deep commitment to exploring the intersections of mind, morality, behavior, and meaning. His primary interests include religious philosophy, ancient philosophy, deontology, and metaphysics—especially where psychological theory and philosophical inquiry converge.</p>

    <p>During his undergraduate years, Morgan was actively involved in campus life, contributing to both academic and extracurricular communities centered on dialogue, reflection, and service. He is currently pursuing graduate studies in philosophy at the Dominican School of Philosophy and Theology in Berkeley, California, where he aims to develop a robust understanding of the human condition through both analytic and historical lenses. Currently, Morgan is studying and engaging in the critical concepts of free will and determinism, particularly within a divine and metaphysical approach.</p>

    <h2>Essays & Talks</h2>
    <ul>

      <p>This section features a curated selection of my academic writing, drawing from both philosophical and psychological disciplines. Topics range from classical thinkers like Aristotle and W.D. Ross to contemporary ethical dilemmas such as terrorism, moral responsibility, and game theory in financial markets. Many of these essays explore the overlap between human cognition and moral reasoning, with a focus on how ancient frameworks can still illuminate modern crises. Also included is a recorded talk addressing the problem of evil, where philosophical inquiry meets psychological insight.</p>

    <p><strong>The Problem of Evil: A Psychological and Philosophical Inquiry</strong></p>

    <p>A cross-disciplinary exploration of classical theodicy and psychological theory, this talk investigates the tension between suffering, moral agency, and belief in a benevolent deity. Using psychological and philosophical perspectives, and drawing from prominent names such as Nietzsche and Dostoevsky, this talk aims to reconcile the existence of natural evil and moral evil with that of a benevolent god. </p>

    <h2>Academic Foundations</h2>
    <p>During my time at the University of Arizona, I was involved in a range of academic opportunities that helped shape my philosophical and psychological interests. These experiences formed the foundation for my current graduate studies and future research aspirations.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Preceptorship in Religion and Spirituality Class, RELIGION 336</strong> – Assisted in undergraduate instruction, facilitated discussions, and supported students in coursework. In addition to being a facilitator for conversations regarding class material, I acted as a mentor and guide for any questions regarding psychology, spirituality, religion, phenomenology, moral questions, metaphysical-related material, and more.</li>
      <li><strong>Research Assistant in Consciousness Action-Time Lab</strong> – Discussed various journals and published papers relating to human consciousness, split-brain syndrome and split consciousness, timed-reactions in labs, and depression/anxiety symptoms and their relationship to timed-reactions and consciousness. Presented information on split-brain syndrome, as well as its relation/application in lab settings. Facilitated conversations regarding the application of lab settings and their implications, and devised lab settings in relation to timed reactions and consciousness.</li>
      <li><strong>Research Assistant in Human Memory Lab</strong> – Transcribed audio files respective to different participants, pertaining to stories induced by cues, images, and particular words. These audio files were then used for data analysis. </li>
      <li><strong>Academic Presentations</strong> – Delivered formal and informal lectures at The Catholic Newman Center in Tucson, Arizona on topics including the problem of evil, early Christian scripture, and the intersection of faith and science.</li>
