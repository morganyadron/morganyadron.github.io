    <h2>About</h2>

    <img src="Facetune_22-06-2023-21-01-45.jpeg" alt="Morgan Yadron's Headshot" class="headshot">

    <p><strong>Morgan David Yadron</strong> recently graduated <em>magna cum laude</em> from the University of Arizona with a B.A. in Psychology and a minor in Philosophy. With a GPA of 3.7, his academic work reflects a deep commitment to exploring the intersections of mind, morality, behavior, and meaning. His primary interests include religious philosophy, ancient philosophy, deontology, and metaphysics—especially where psychological theory and philosophical inquiry converge.</p>

    <p>During his undergraduate years, Morgan was actively involved in campus life, contributing to both academic and extracurricular communities centered on dialogue, reflection, and service. He is currently pursuing graduate studies in philosophy at the Dominican School of Philosophy and Theology in Berkeley, California, where he aims to develop a robust understanding of the human condition through both analytic and historical lenses. Currently, Morgan is studying and engaging in the critical concepts of moral realism, Thomistic Natural Law, objective morality, and morality's relation to human evolution, anthropology, and the cultivation of character.</p>

    <p>In addition to his formal philosophical training, Morgan has undertaken international travel aimed at deepening his understanding of Western intellectual and religious traditions. His time in Italy—visiting cities such as Rome, Florence, Venice, Milan, and Naples—and Switzerland’s St. Moritz has provided firsthand engagement with the historical and cultural landscape shaped by Catholicism and Christianity. While in Rome, Morgan met with clergy and explored ecclesiastical sites, gaining unique historical and theological insight into the origins and propagation of the Christian faith. These experiences have meaningfully informed his academic work, particularly in the areas of religious philosophy, metaphysics, and moral theology.</p>

    <h2>Essays & Talks</h2>
    <ul>

      <p>This section features a curated selection of my academic writing, drawing from both philosophical and psychological disciplines. Topics range from classical thinkers like Aristotle and W.D. Ross to contemporary ethical dilemmas such as terrorism, moral responsibility, and game theory in financial markets. Many of these essays explore the overlap between human cognition and moral reasoning, with a focus on how ancient frameworks can still illuminate modern crises. Also included is a recorded talk addressing the problem of evil, where philosophical inquiry meets psychological insight.</p>

    <p><strong>The Problem of Evil: A Psychological and Philosophical Inquiry: April, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>A cross-disciplinary exploration of classical theodicy and psychological theory, this talk investigates the tension between suffering, moral agency, and belief in a benevolent deity. Using psychological and philosophical perspectives, and drawing from prominent names such as Nietzsche and Dostoevsky, this talk aims to reconcile the existence of natural evil and moral evil with that of a benevolent god. </p>

    <p><strong>God or Prophet?: A Critical Analysis into the Divinity of Jesus Christ</strong></p>
<p>Was Jesus merely a prophetic apocalyptic Jew, or was he truly the Son of God? This video offers a critical and nuanced exploration of one of history’s most consequential and important figures — Jesus of Nazareth — through the lenses of history, theology, and philosophy. Drawing on the works of scholars such as N.T. Wright, Larry Hurtado, C.S. Lewis, Albert Schweitzer, David Alan Black, Bart Ehrman, and Richard Bauckham, I examine the historical Jesus, the early Church’s explosive rise through the lens of Paul, and the enduring question of Jesus’ divinity. This presentation incorporates both canonical texts (New American Bible Revised Edition) and relevant non-canonical sources to weigh the evidence with honesty and intellectual fairness.</p>

    <p><strong>The Historicity of Christianity and Christian Apologetics: Talk Transcript, February, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>A live apologetics talk delivered in a pastoral fashion at the University of Arizona’s Newman Center, this presentation examines the historical, fundemental, and psychological foundations of Christianity. Using philosophical reasoning, early textual evidence, and cognitive science, it argues for the plausibility and truth of the Gospel accounts, culminating in a robust defense of Christ’s resurrection and its implications for human freedom and hope.</p>
